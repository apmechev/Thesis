\section{Summary of Thesis Achievements}

This work focuses on the software built to accelerate and parallelize LOFAR processing and the insights obtained into large scale processing of LOFAR data. To date, we have helped process an unprecedented 8 petabytes of data for the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), data which has led to  more than 30 publications. We describe a generic platform for scaling astronomical processing across multiple clusters, focused on the solutions for bulk LOFAR processing.  


\section{Applications}

While this work focuses specifically on accelerating LOFAR workflows, specificaly the \texttt{prefactor} pipeline, the software developed can be integrated with any arbitrary processing pipeline.  


\section{Future Work}

The Square Kilometer Array, (SKA) is a planned aperture synthesis radio telescope expected to have a total collecting area of one square kilometer.
