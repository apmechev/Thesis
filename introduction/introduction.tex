\subsection{Publications}

Chapter ~\ref{ch:LOFAR_DSP} describes our first attempts to do large-scale distributed LOFAR processing on a shared infrastructure. We detail our successes with the LOFAR Radio Recombination Lines and Pre-Processing Pipelines, our software set-up as well as the limitations and future uses of this platform.  


Chapter ~\ref{ch:GRID_LRT} is our implementation for portable LOFAR processing on a massive scale. We show early results encapsulating LOFAR processing pipelines, and discuss future uses on other clusters. It is based on:  \fullcite{mechev17}.

Chapter ~\ref{ch:pipeline_collector} discusses our work collecting detailed performance statistics from automated LOFAR processing. It is based on: \fullcite{mechev_pipeline_collector}.

Chapter ~\ref{ch:AGLOW} is based on: \fullcite{ieee_AGLOW}.

%Chapter \ref{ch:Scalability_model} is based on: \fullcite{parameteric_model}
