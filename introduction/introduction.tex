\subsection{Motivation and Objectives}

The goal of this work is to create a system to quickly, easily and reliably process data from the LOFAR radio telescope. This telescope produces tens of terabytes of data per day, and our objective is to create software to automatically process this data.  

\subsection{Contributions}
 
For this work, we built several software packages to define, launch, and orchestrate jobs on a high throughput cluster. The software packages built are GRID\_LRT\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apmechev/GRID_LRT/}}, GRID\_PiCaS\_Launcher\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apmechev/GRID_PiCaS_Launcher}} and AGLOW\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apmechev/AGLOW}}. They are available on GitHub and their documentation is hosted on Readthedocs.

\subsection{Publications}

Chapter ~\ref{ch:LOFAR_DSP} describes our first attempts to do large-scale distributed LOFAR processing on a shared infrastructure. We detail our successes with the LOFAR Radio Recombination Lines and Pre-Processing Pipelines, our software set-up as well as the limitations and future uses of this platform.  


Chapter ~\ref{ch:GRID_LRT} is our implementation for portable LOFAR processing on a massive scale. We show early results encapsulating LOFAR processing pipelines, and discuss future uses on other clusters. It is based on:  \fullcite{mechev17}.

Chapter ~\ref{ch:pipeline_collector} discusses our work collecting detailed performance statistics from automated LOFAR processing. It is based on: \fullcite{mechev_pipeline_collector}.

Chapter ~\ref{ch:AGLOW} describes the capabilities of the initial workflow manager for automatic processing of LOFAR SKSP data. It shows several different scientific workflows and is based on: \fullcite{ieee_AGLOW}.

%Chapter \ref{ch:Scalability_model} is based on: \fullcite{parameteric_model}
