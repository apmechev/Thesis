Hard to believe that it was four whole years ago that I returned to Leiden to pursue a Ph.D. at the Sterrewacht. Over these years, I was lucky to make so many colourful friends and vivid memories, all of which made the 'Winter' weather a little more bearable. I'm not sure a few short pages can summarize the beautiful people I spent my time at the Sterrewacth with, but I'll have to try nevertheless.

    First, I'd like to thank the diverse and energetic LOFAR group. Josh, who always has a new intriguing topic to discuss, and is overflowing with ambitious ideas. Jit, who is that friend that every friend needs. It's no wonder he's the go-to choice for a paranymph: he's reliable and easy going, and that's no secret! Kim and Pedro, probably the first real users of my software must be commended on their patience and goodwill. Frits, with whom we've shared too many moments complaining about software over beer (or coffee, or tea, or over messenger), I wish you best of luck with the heavy mantle of making sure our software works. Gabriella, Andrea, and Francesco, grouped together for no particular reason at all, running into you randomly (or pseudo-randomly) in Bologna was a pleasant surprise. You'd be happy to know that you'll always be associated in my mind with quality food and quality time together. Federica, Amanda, and Leah, the renouned LOFAR ladies, it is always a pleasure running into you at our conferences and workshops, both in the Netherlands and abroad. I sincerely wish you the utmost success in your careers. Carole, I had lots of fun on the many occasions we spent together. Thanks for being enthusiastic enough to join me at a beer festival just before a long week of LOFAR workshopping. Wendy, Martijn, Reinout, and Rafael, it's a pleasure bumping into you and riffing off some ideas in the KL, or just around the Sterrewacht. Aayush, we've had some good chats together, hope Rome is treating you well! Nicolina, my half-Bulgarian sista, I miss our workshops and conferences, hope we run into each other again.

    To my slav friends, it was a pleasure squatting with you. Although we only had a couple of slav dinner nights together, they were a complete success! Matus, you have been the best neighbour and most reliable friend one could wish for. I wish you all the success, and hope we still have beers at Plantage every once in a while. Give the bunnies a hug from me! L\'ydia, thank you so much for your kind words and all the chats we had together. Andrej, you are already sorely missed in our friday borrels. Best of luck in Germany and keep on dancing! Liuba, it was pleasure sailing with a seasoned sailer as you. The stories fro your sailing trip still inspire me to one day drop everything and sail the seven seas (yarrr). Aleksandrina, it's always great seeing you at LEO events! It was you who introduced me to LEO, and it looked so fun I decided to be part of the board myself! Vanja, the dishes you bring to our slavic dinners were all exceptional! It's been lots of fun to have someone that you can practically understand in your native tongue.  Micha\l{}, \L{}ukasz, and Aleksandra, it's always a party when you're around! Thanks for bringing the Polish atmosphere with you, and of course thanks for the pierogi.

    To all borrel peeps, thanks for all our chats on Fridays! Merrel, Arthur, and Jeroen, thanks for bringing the neccessary Dutchness to our borrels. Dilovan, hope you keep channelling your inner Mallory Archer and that the future borrel committees treat you with quality wine! Mantas, keep dropping sick beats at the sterrewacht parties! Anna, u w0t m8? I'm flattered that you take me as a fashion authority, I'll pretend that I actually am. Sanjana, hope one day you are able to adopt a little duckling. Let me know if you hear about those prestigous post-docs at McDonalds, they're hard to come across I hear. Fraser, Alex, and Maaike, I'll miss having the occasional Canadian corner at our borrel.

    To the big Dipper, thanks for organizing our weekly celebration of a week well spent. I will always remember that there's a slight possibility that bees \bees{1F41D} are just mad \bees{1F621} bee\bees{1F41D}cause someone cut\bees{2702}them off in traffic\bees{1F698}\bees{1F621}\bees{1F697}\bees{1F621}\bees{1F699}\bees{1F616}\bees{1F68C}. I hope I don't turn into a bee in mid acknow--

   Our agraphia group was a fun little exercise and really helped me regiment my writing. Thanks Francisca for setting it up. It was fun doing our bi-weekly calls with you \L{}ukasz and Ylva. We made so much progress together! To all my Astronomy On Tap compatriots, it was plenty fun running the events together. Liz and Vincent, thanks for putting in all the work to organize these events, your work really made the events memorable. Fran, Carmen,  and Themiya, your hard work makes the events run smoothly. Maaike, my partner in crime, filming is always more fun when you're around. Best of luck heading the video team when I'm gone! Alex, we gotta catch another Rye and ginger at de Burcht. No Canada Dry, but we'll make do. To the rest of the LOFAR e-infra group, Natalie, Coen, Raymond, Zheng and Tim, Thanks for all the help, ideas and support, both technical and personal. Mark, Maria, Kelly, and Laura, I will miss running into you at API, the occasionaly party or LOFAR conference.
